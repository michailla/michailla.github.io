  <p id="rcorners1"><b>Pros of Algorithms</b><br/> 
    <u>Technological Innovations:</u> To the average person, increased use of big data and algorithms means that more advancements in technology. This can make life for the individual easier and more convenient. <br/>
  <u>"Logical" or "Objective" Decisions:</u> Individuals can leave decisions up to algorithms and machines, such as marriage or career path, for the most optimal results based on the collective and connected knowledge of algorithms.<br/>
    <u>Links all Disciplines:</u> When all elements of life, whether biological or mechanical, are boiled down into algorithms, a common language can be used in all disciplines. This makes discussion and study between scholars simpler.</p>
  <p id="rcorners2"><b>Cons or Algorithms</b></br>
  <u>Inherent Bias:</u>While algorithms might appear mysterious and nebulous to the average person, there actual people with actual biases behind the algorithm who control at least one part of the pie. This means that, while algorithms might be thought as completely objective and scientific, algorithms can make harmful decisions based on prejudice towards women, minorities, etc. <br/>
  <u>Loss of Autonomy and Privacy:</u> While the sacrifice of some privacy and autonomy is often seen as a fair price for the convenience of algorithms, if individuals do not take the time to learn and understand computer algorithms or big data they will not understand the decisions being made for them or the biases behind them <br/>
  <u>Power to a Few:</u>Since algorithms are considered overly complicated and "otherwordly," only a small portion of the population understands them. This could mean that only they will have the power to make big decisions or changes, and no public discourse can take place.<br/>
<u>The "Big Picture":</u> Algorithms based solely on decision making will not come up with solutions to world hunger, global warming, or other potential future tragedies. Big data and algorithms encourage people to continue the flow of information without utilizing it, which could mean allowing future tragedies to take place.</p>
<div class=div3><h2>What's the Big Deal?</h2> It's just a set of instructions given to a computer which are then performed! While we take algorithms for granted, algorithms in turn are changing the way society functions in the 21st century and beyond. It is certainly beneficial for anyone to look more closely at <b>why</b> we use them, <b>who</b> benefits from them, and <b>what</b> they mean for our future.</div>
